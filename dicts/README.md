# Codenames Dictionaries

Dictionaries in this directory contain word lists to be used in Codenames.

## Contributing

Files must be utf-8 encoded, and each word must be on a separate line.
There must be no empty lines in the file.

If you want to add more languages, find ISO 639-2 code for the language
(the three-letter one), and use "txt" as a file extension. You can use
[this page](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php)
to find the ISO 639-2 code for the language.
